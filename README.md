# Responsive-Portfolio

## Getting Started
Hello. This is an updated version of my portfolio site with a responsive layout. My class was tasked with making the website respond to at least three different breakpoints.

## Prerequisites
Only a web browser is needed to view these pages. 

## Built With
Visual Studio Code
HTML, CSS language

## Versioning 
This is the only version of the site. It will be updated continually.

## Authors
Pete Widders

## Licensing
This project was not made under any license as it was made for school.

## Acknowledgments
I really learned a lot about media inquires and the importance of formatting for mobile. It also really made me appreciate Bootstrap as I wrote all the code on this one :)
